        <p>
          Crossify is (probably) the largest publicly available computer-generated
          collection of American-style "dense" crosswords â€” 25,000 and counting! 
          Our grids satisfy the usual rules, notably:
          <ul>
            <li>
              All-over interlock: No part of the grid is completely cut off by 
              black squares, and each square is contained in exactly two clues.
            </li>
            <li>
              At most one-sixth of squares in the grid are black.
            </li>
          </ul>
          We are open-source! Check out our <a
