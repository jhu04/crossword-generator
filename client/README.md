# crosswords

I wrote this as an exercise while learning React. At the time, it was almost a pixel perfect clone of the NYTimes
crossword app. 

You can see a demo of the app [here](https://shopkeeper-capacity-56747.netlify.com/puzzle/oscar). I made this crossword
as a farewell to my coworkers at [Oscar](https://www.hioscar.com/) so you might not get very far!

If you want to use it with your own crosswords, copy the [schema](https://shopkeeper-capacity-56747.netlify.com/puzzles/oscar.json)
from the demo above with your own layout and clues and place the json files in the `dist/puzzles` directory.
